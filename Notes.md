# Notes from the solution show
*After the solution done*
- Worth to check if the choice A = choice B, then regenerate
- The Compare B could be selected in the init phase, ans assign always to Compare A, and again generate Compare B. This will result in A being B if it reruns, but if it is a new game, then two new Comparision.
